### FRC Team 5892's Java Library

This is a repository for FRC Team 5892, the Energy HEROs, to put code that is useful enough in the future to not just go in the yearly robot code. Other FRC teams are free to use it themselves. And I guess people who aren't on FRC teams, though I don't see any other use case for it. ~~Just download it and include it in your Eclipse project~~ **Apparently the way WPILib compiles stuff is dumb. For now, just copy all the stuff in the "src" folder into your project's "src" folder. Once I figure out a way to add arbitrary stuff to the build path, this will be updated.**

Our current actual robot code is at https://github.com/Team5892Steamworks/FRC2017Command.
