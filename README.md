### FRC Team 5892's Java Library

This is a repository for FRC Team 5892, the Energy HEROs, to put code that is useful enough in the future to not just go in the yearly robot code. Other FRC teams are free to use it themselves. And I guess people who aren't on FRC teams, though I don't see any other use case for it. Just download it and include it in your Eclipse project.

Our current actual robot code is at https://github.com/Team5892Steamworks/FRC2017Command.
